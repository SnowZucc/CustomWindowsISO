# CustomWindowsISO
Here are my yearly Windows custom minimal ISOs. I will upload the previous ones later.

## Laptop2024
This year I needed to make an Win10 22H2 ISO for my new laptop. This ISO is a mix of debloating and keeping everything functionnal as I will not only be gaming on this computer.

No preinstalled apps but I left the camera, calculator etc... 
I've removed a good but reasonable amount of services so that everything is still supposed to work.
Windows defender on.
I left all the MS store and Xbox crap to leave everything functionnal.

For more information, you can find the preset on the presets folder.
Note : The installation language is french.
